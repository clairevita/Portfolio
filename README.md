# Portfolio Website

## welcome ðŸŽ² to ðŸŽ² my ðŸŽ² portfolio ðŸŽ²

This web page highlights a handful of projects I've directed, managed, or participated in. This app uses the React library to host a clean front end experience, and organized method for component design and implementation. 

I wanted this page to provide a fundamental framework for me to develop further as I complete projects related to my participation in the Penn LPS Coding as well as personal and professional projects I develop in the future. It's framework is minimalist to future-proof for any design redirections I may want through my career.

## Portfolio

The Portfolio page currently features 4 images which span the full width of the page. The first three show images of my most recent projects, while the fourth is a blank image. They are each titled and dated.

When you change the page resolution they orient to stack on top of eachother. Their flexible status enables accessible design for any device.

Clicking one of the images, a modal pops up populated dynamically with the project's used technology and relevant links.
